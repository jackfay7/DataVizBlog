    "text": "The dataset for this project comes from Kaggle and contains a wide range of FIFA player ratings and attributes from 2015-2023 Career Mode. On a FIFA card, each player has an overall rating accompanied by six central statistics: pace, shooting, passing, dribbling, defense, and physical. Aside from player statistics, the dataset also includes demographic information such as the nationality, league, and team of the players. Initially, the data included all players, male and female, yet to allow for my ShinyApp to run with better speed I used a subset of the data that only included male players with ratings of 80 and higher. The final subset contains 24 variables and 232,116 observations. The data set affords many avenues of comparison among players via demographic information and it allows for multiple comparisons of the same players across different seasons. From a longitudinal standpoint, I am particularly interested in comparing specific player attributes over the course of their careers in an attempt to see how their perceived skills in that area have changed relative to other players. Additionally, I aim to compare the central six attributes of the players within specific seasons to see how players differ in their strong suits despite sharing the same overall rating. The central goal of this project is to provide a tool for player comparison where users can select their desired players and explore their own questions of interest.\nKaggle Link\nSource & License"

    "text": "Conclusion and Wrap-Up\nOne of the flaws with the approach of the first plot is that you cannot see change over time in life expectancy for these countries. The second plot does a better job of accomplishing this, yet there are so many countries in each continent it is hard to look at the lines behind the average. I think moving farward, it would be better to subset the data to include fewer countries or just focus on one continent."

The map allows you to compare the values geographically, however, if you are trying to show change over time it does not make as much sense. For that reason, I switched my approach and showed how average life expectancys by continent change throughout time. You cannot see the individual countries as well as in the first plot, but it conveys far more information."

    "text": "Conclusion and Wrap-Up\nIn conclusion, the class imbalance of the default target variable is a limitation to this analysis. This may lead to model bias, as the model is likely to favor non-defaulting accounts because, as said before, nearly 97% of cases did not in fact default. Additional interest with the analysis pertain to the oddities of the our student variable. My common sense would lead me to believe that students would be more likely to default but this was not the case, as shown by the model summary and the visualization. In the future, I would certainly further investigate the impacts of being a student on probability of defaulting, and overall financial well being. Lastly, I think that an expanded data set with more metrics would certainly add to the capabilities of analysis."

The process of creating the model, using the grid feature to make predictions at different values of our predictors, and displaying the resulting model allows viewers to understand precisely how the model is gauging probability for cases. Additionally, the use of the ribbon helps to display model uncertainty in terms of standard error."

Additionally, I will examine the Poisson model fit and any potential impacts caused by overdispersion.\n\nData\nData are available from a study on horseshoe crabs. Female horseshoe crabs often have male crabs attached to a female’s nest known as satellites. One objective of the study was to determine which characteristics of the female were associated with the number of satellites. Of particular interest is the relationship between the width of the female carapace and satellites.\nThe data can be found in crab.csv. It includes: - NumStat = number of satellites - Width = carapace width (cm) - Weight = weight (kg) - Spine = spine condition (1 = both good, 2 = one worn or broken, 3 = both worn or broken) - Color = (2 = light medium, 3 = medium, 4 = dark medium, 5 = dark)\n\n\n\nPart 1: Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nggplot(crab, aes(x = Satellite)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = .25) + \n  xlab(\"Number of Satellites\") +\n  ylab(\"Count of Crabs\")\n\n\n\nmean(crab$Satellite)\n\n[1] 2.919075\n\nvar(crab$Satellite)\n\n[1] 9.912018\n\n\nIt seems that the mode count of satellites is zero.

I used a negative binomial model to adjust for this overdispersion, which appeared to work effectively in that regard. While the adjustment reduced the overdispersion, the significance of all predictors dropped substantially. Despite that, there is still evidence that the model is useful (X^2 = 22.82, p-value = 0.0018).\nOverall Model Utility\n\nts &lt;- 219.74 - 196.92\ndf &lt;- 7 \n\npchisq(ts, df, lower.tail = FALSE)\n\n[1] 0.001832075"
